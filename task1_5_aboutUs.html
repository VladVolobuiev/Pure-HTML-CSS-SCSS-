        CEDA Maps a.s. (CEDA) has been an active player on the Czech and Slovak markets with geospatial data for 20 years. Over these years CEDA has been recognised as an independent, purely Czech data agency, dealing with collection, processing and distribution of geospatial data of high quality covering the entire area of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Since the very beginning CEDA focuses on production of positionally as well as informationally accurate data mostly related to transportation. We are delivering such data to TomTom for production of global digital navigational database.

        Recently we have expended our product portfolio by moving towards provision of web-based services for smooth visualisation, management and integration of map-based data. The project department focuses on implementation of services mostly related to intelligent traffic-oriented information systems. We are also Google Cloud Partner offering the entire spectrum of Google Map products. Since 2014 we are positioning ourselves on the emerging indoor navigation and positioning market.
